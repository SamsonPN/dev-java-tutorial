    "* notions you have to keep in mind:\n",
    "    - a hashmap can store key-value pairs\n",
    "    - a key acts as a symbol for a given value\n",
    "    - a key is a simple object, a value can be as complex as needed\n",
    "    - a key is unique in a hashmpa, a value does not have to be unique\n",
    "    - every value stored in a hashmap has to be bound to a key, a key-value pair in a map forms an _entry_ of that map\n",
    "    - a key can be used to retrieve its bound value\n",
    "* the Collections Framework gives you a Map interface that implements this concept along with 2 extensions:\n",
    "    1. SortedMap\n",
    "    2. Navigable Map\n",
    "* the Map hierarchy is pretty similar to the Set hierarchy since there is a SortedSet and a NavigableSet:\n",
    "    - a SortedMap has the same semantics as a SortedSet\n",
    "        * a SortedMap is a map that keeps its key-value pairs sorted by their keys\n",
    "    - for the NavigableMap: the methods added by this are similar to the ones added by NavigableSet to SortedSet\n",
    "* the JDK gives you several implementations of the Map interface:\n",
    "    - HashMap: the most widely used one\n",
    "    - LinkedHashMap: a HashMap with an internal structure to keep the key-value pairs ordered\n",
    "        * iterating over the keys or the key-value pairs will follow the order in which you added your key-value pairs\n",
    "    - IdentityHashMap: a specialized Map that should only be used in very precise cases\n",
    "        * not meant to be generally used in application\n",
    "        * instead of using equals() and hashCode() to compare key objects, this implementation only compares the references to these keys using an equality operator (==)\n",
    "* there is a concept called a Multimap where a single key can be associated to more than one value\n",
    "    - it's currently not directly supported in the Collections Framework\n",
    "    - but you can create maps withvalues that are lists of values which can create multimap-like structures\n",
