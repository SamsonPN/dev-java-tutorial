    "* __Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields):__\n",
    "    - objects store their individual states in \"non-static fields\" - fields that are declared __without the static keyword__\n",
    "    - these variables are __unique__ to each instance of a class (i.e. to each object)\n",
    "        * e.g. the currentSpeed of one bicycle is independent from the currentSpeed of another\n",
    "* __Class Variables (Static Fields):__\n",
    "    - any field declared __with the static modifier__\n",
    "    - it tells the compiler that there is only 1 copy of this variable in existence __regardless of how many times this class has been instantiated__\n",
    "        * e.g. static int numGrears = 6; \n",
    "        * any Bicycle object crated from the Bicycle class will have 6 gears\n",
    "        * additionally, the keyword __final__ could be added to indicate that the number of gears will never change\n",
    "* __Local Variables:__\n",
    "    - methods will store its temporary state in local variables\n",
    "    - no special keyword for designating a variable as local but rather where the variable is declared\n",
    "    - not accessible from the rest of the class\n",
    "* __Parameters:__\n",
    "    - for main method signature: public static void main(String[] args), the args variable is a parameter to this method\n",
    "    - parameters are always classified as variables, not fields\n",
    "        * this also applies to other parameter-accepting constructs like constructors and exception handlers\n",
    "* the tutorial also mentions the term \"member\"\n",
    "    - this refers to a type's fields, methods, and nested types"
