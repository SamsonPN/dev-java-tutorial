    "* primitive values do not share state with other primitive values\n",
    "* the 8 primitive data types are:\n",
    "    1. byte:\n",
    "        - 8-bit\n",
    "        - signed\n",
    "        - two's complement\n",
    "        - integer\n",
    "        - min value of -128 and max value of 127 (inclusive)\n",
    "            * reason being 1 of the bits is used for signing (+/-) with two's complement\n",
    "            * therefore, the range is for $2^{7}$ = 128 \n",
    "        - useful for saving memory in large arrays where memory\n",
    "        - can also be used in place of int where their limits help to clarify code\n",
    "            * i.e. the fact that a variable's range is limited can serve as a form of documentation\n",
    "    2. short:\n",
    "        - 16-bit\n",
    "        - signed\n",
    "        - two's complement\n",
    "        - integer\n",
    "        - min value of -32,768 and max value of 32,767 (inclusive)\n",
    "        - can use short to save memory in large arrays, like byte\n",
    "    3. int:\n",
    "        - 32-bit\n",
    "        - signed\n",
    "        - two's complement\n",
    "        - integer\n",
    "        - min value of -2$^{31}$ and a max value of 2$^{31}$ - 1\n",
    "        - in Java SE 8+, int can be used to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer which has a min value of 0 and a max value of 2^${32}$ - 1\n",
    "            * use the _Integer_ class to use int data type as an unsigned integer\n",
    "    4. long:\n",
    "        - 64-bit\n",
    "        - two's complement\n",
    "        - integer\n",

    "        - use this when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int\n",
    "    5. float:\n",
    "        - single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point\n",
    "        - use float, instead of double, if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers\n",
    "        - should never be used for precise values, such as currency\n",
    "            * for that, use java.math.BigDecimal class instead\n",
    "    6. double:\n",
    "        - double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point\n",
    "        - for decimal values, this data type is the default choice\n",
    "        - should never be used for precise values like currency\n",
    "    7. boolean:\n",
    "        - has only 2 possible values: true and false\n",
    "        - used for simple flags that track true/false conditions\n",
    "        - represents one bit of information\n",
    "    8. char:\n",
    "        - single 16-bit unicode character\n",
    "        - minimum value of \\u0000 (or 0) and a maximum value of \\uffff (or 65,535 inclusive)\n",
    "* Java also provides support for character strings via java.lang.String class\n",
    "    - enclosing character string within double quotes will automatically create a new String object\n",
    "        * e.g. String s = \"this is a string\";\n",
    "    - String objects are immutable (once created, their values cannot be changed)\n",
